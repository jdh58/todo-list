# To-Do List

__ToDo's for my ToDo:__
- Make form validation work so you can't submit empty names
- Add colors to each ToDo to signify which project it's apart of
- Add "No Date" text instead of emptiness to ToDos without a date
- Add ability to move ToDos up and down
- Add some sort of visual to signify priority level
- Re-configure code to be simpler and more readable
- Add working collapse/show arrows for most headers and navbar
- Implement ability to edit/delete current projects
- Add icon library so you can use those for projects instead of colors
- Make the circle work for clicking when completing ToDos
- Have the projects list scroll independently of the nav bar
- Cloud storage/online storage you can login to access
- Fix the odd functionality when completing multiple tasks in quick succession

This sounds like a long list but I'm still fairly happy with the project.
